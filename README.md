# Sample Chat: Simplest chat application with Node.js and WebSocket.

## Note

I got stuck on socket.io implementation between ver.6 and 7. Tried my best to make it simple. 
See: https://github.com/LearnBoost/Socket.IO/wiki/Migrating-0.6-to-0.7+ for more information.

## How to Install

Clone this git repo and run `npm install` under the root of the project.


## How to Demo 
1. Modify config.js change server host and port to match your environment.
2. Modify index.html change serverip / serverport to match your environment. Should be used the same host/port with step 1)
3. $node app.js


## Web Browsers

As long as I test, it works on Chrome and IE9. (FF / Safari should be working fine)

## Credit

Great thanks.
